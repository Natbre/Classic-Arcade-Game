## **How to play**

The aim is to gain as much points ad you can. How to do that? You just need to cross the road and reach for the water.Every time you reach the water, you receive 10 points But be aware! There are enemies on the road! Watch out for bugs that are waiting for you life! Do not worry too much though. You have 5 lives to lose before you die for good .  :thumbsup: :clap:
